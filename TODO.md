## TODO
1. ~Add link to play store for the app (Right now it shows a static content from the database).~ - No internet, so this is the best option.
2. Step by step guidance to use this tool - README.md
3. Troubleshooting document
4. ~Check `MobileDevice/` to write a python script that can do the scanning stuff.~   (Does not work on python3!!)


5. Search for appIds with spy
6. IOS how to uninstall the apps. 


## Data TODO
1. A csv file containing all the `appIds`,
`store`={'android', 'ios', 'offstpre'}, and `flag`={'dual-use', 'spyware'}
2. A file containing `appId`, `name`, and `url` of all apps we have seen so far.

## Data visualization
1. Create an interface for retrieveing and viewing the stored data. 
   a. The stored scan results
   b. Dumps of phones associated with the client
   c. Technograph, TAQ10 results, and summary form
   d. All notes associated with the client
